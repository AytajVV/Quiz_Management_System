A learning management system is a software application or web-based technology used to plan, implement and assess a specific learning process. It's used for e-learning practices and, in its most common form, consists of two elements: a server that performs the base functionality and a user interface (UI) that is operated by instructors, students and administrators.

Typically, an LMS provides an instructor with a way to create and deliver content, monitor student participation, and assess student performance. It might also provide students with interactive features, such as threaded discussions, video conferencing and discussion forums.

Businesses, government agencies, and traditional and online educational institutions often use these systems. They can improve traditional educational methods, while also saving organizations time and money. An effective system lets instructors and administrators efficiently manage elements such as user registration and access, content, calendars, communication, quizzes, certifications and notifications.

Some popular LMSes used by educational institutions include Moodle, Anthology's Blackboard Learn and PowerSchool's Schoology Learning. Popular enterprise-level LMSes include Adobe Learning Manager, Docebo Learn LMS, eFront, iSpring Learn and TalentLMS.
